       " 'the maincomponent of marble is calcite, or calcium carbonate, joinedwith other constituents such as dolomite, or magnesium calcium carbonate, and argonite',\n",
       " 'marble also contains many ofthe socalled \"earth\" elements—such as sodium, potassium,barium, and aluminum—as well as many of the \"metallic\"elements—such as iron, copper, manganese, and chromium,which cause the tremendous variations of colors and sedimentary patterns so often seen in roman sculptures and buildings',\n",

       " 'we are concerned mainly with the marble sourcesnear the mediterranean. wellknown areas in greece such asmount pentelicus, mount paros, the island of naxos, andmount hemetian were important sources of marble for theclassical world and were mined by both greeks and romans',\n",
       " 'the major quarry on the italian peninsula was and still is carrara; renowned marbles found there are composed of dolomiteor calcite mixed with magnesium calcium carbonite.alabaster, which is actually calcium sulphate, is often confused with marble',\n",
       " 'however, it has a hardness of 2 on thediamond scale—a system of measurement which uses tenminerals as constants, with diamond, at 10, the hardest—while calcite and dolomite, the components of true marble,have hardnesses of 3 and 4, respectively, resulting in greaterresistance to wear',\n",
       " 'alabaster is more susceptible than marbleto damage from water. for all intents and purposes, marble isinsoluble in pure water; however, the smallest trace of carbondioxide in the water will cause rapid degeneration of the surface',\n",
       " 'other gases such as sulphate—greatly increased in theatmosphere by pollution—and atomic sulphur will causealteration of the calcite into calcium sulphate, a substance4 surface cleaningwhich, bearing a different expansion coefficient than the marble surface, will easily crumble away',\n",

       " 'when a substance likep.v.a. gets into the pores of a material such as marble, it tendsto shrink or otherwise act as a substance of different densitythan the body of the artwork',\n",
       " 'cements and grouts of various kinds canleave a grey cast on or in the stone because they can chemically interact with the material and penetrate its structure; inmost cases, they are also harder than the marble.a thorough cleaning of the surface should precede the application of any adhesive',\n",
       " \"before discussing the actual cleaningprocedure, it is best to point out several precautions. oftensculpture has remnants of pigment present on its surface6 surface cleaningmarble cupids in the process of being cleanedwhich act as a valuable record of the work's original appearance\",\n",
