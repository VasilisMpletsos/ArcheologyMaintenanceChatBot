what is the leading cause of stone decay?,"elements of repairstoneour services brick, concrete, render terracotta, faience steel work corrosion contact  usszerelmey restoration and conservation guide c ommon causes–   water penetration is the leading  instigator of stone decay and the three major causes of stone decay are: 1"
what is the most important factor in the ability to resist decaying processes?,crystallisation of soluble salt 2. frost 3. pollutants–   the individual structure of the stone  is the most important factor in its ability  to resist decaying processes
is harder or harder to get rid of?,"–   the more porous the stone (softer) such as limestone, the greater susceptibility  it has to decay.–  less porous stone (harder) such as granite is less subject to decay"
is a stone more or less susceptible to frost damage?,"frost–   like salt crystallisation, frost damage to stone is directly influenced by the stone’s porosity – the more porous the stone, the more susceptible to frost damage it will be"
is there a reason for frost damage on the stone structure?,–   frost damage occurs due to the expansion of water during freezing; the expansion puts stress on the stone structure leading to cracking and damage
What is it called when a straw dislodges fragments of stone?,–   frost damage can also be the ‘final  straw’ that dislodges fragments of  stone that have been subjected to other types of decay
can soluble salts soak in to porous stone?,"cry stallisation of soluble salts–   salts occur naturally in the environment and can soak in to porous stone as  a result of rainwater, groundwater,  sea spray; sometimes salts can be  left as a byproduct of unsuitable  cleaning solutions"
when do salts crystallize within stone pores?,–   when salts crystallise within stone pores they can generate sufficient stress to cause fragmentation
"Due to the chemical reactions between limestone and acid pollutants in rainwater, what is the concentration","–   the concentration of salts and the damage they incur is increased due to the chemical reactions between limestone and acid pollutants in rainwater such as sulphuric acid, which produces gypsum (calcium sulphate)"
is gypsum the same as stone decay?,it is this gypsum that is most frequently associated with stone decay of limestone
what happens to the salt when it is wet?,"–   the salt is soluble and passes into solution when the stone is wet through heavy rainfall, then crystallises on drying out. this repeated process causes damage  to the stone"
Are sheltered parts of the building exposed to moisture or dew?,"this repeated process causes damage  to the stone.–   sheltered parts of the building that are out of direct rainfall are exposed to moisture in the form of mist, fog or dew"
what is it called when gypsum is formed over a stone?,"this moisture is invariably pollutantheavy and known as occult deposition. this encourages the formation of gypsum which forms a hard, filthy crust over the stone"
the crust of gypsum is formed by the formation of what?,"this encourages the formation of gypsum which forms a hard, filthy crust over the stone. often the stone will begin to crumble underneath this surface crust"
can gypsum or calcium sulphate cause damage to other building materials?,often the stone will begin to crumble underneath this surface crust.–   gypsum or calcium sulphate can leach from limestone and cause damage to other building materials
is there a such a thing as crystallization damage?,"–   crystallisation damage caused by freely soluble salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulphate or sodium hydroxide normally consists of a powdering and crumbling of the entire surface of the contaminated stone"
Wind erosion of what is significant in this country?,–   in this country wind erosion of stone is negligible and when it does occur is in direct relation to a high concentration  of crystallising salts.1
who is the leading instigator in corrosion?,"stone decaystone our services brick, concrete, render terracotta, faience steel work corrosion contact  us11szerelmey restoration and conservation guide12stone our services brick, concrete, render terracotta, faience steel work corrosion contact  usthis page:crystallised	salts	can	be	seen	clearly	on	the	facade	of	this	buildingszerelmey restoration and conservation guide p ollutants–  water penetration is the leading instigator"
are acid rain and air born pollutants the same?,–   the chief pollutants influencing stone decay are acid rain and air born pollutants
is calcium carbonate and limestone the same thing?,"–   limestone and marble are primarily composed of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate) which dissolves readily in weak acid, making both these substances prone to decay from acid rain or air  born pollutants"
are feldspar and quartz resistant to acid?,–   granite on the other hand is chiefly composed of silicate minerals such  as feldspar and quartz which are  resistant to acid. some sandstones are similarly resistant
are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide the same thing?,"–   the main components that contribute to both acid rain and air born pollution are sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide, both of which are a byproduct from burning fossil fuels like  coal and oil"
"when do sulphuric, sulphurous and nitric acids react with the calcite in","when these sulphuric, sulphurous and nitric acids react with  the calcite in limestone and marble the  calcite dissolves"
can some sandstones be resistant to acid rain?,"contour scaling–   while some sandstones are more resistant to acid rain than other types of stone, they can be prone to a type of decay called contour scaling"
Why does a crust form after the contours of the surface of the stone?,"–   a crust forms following the contours of the surface of the stone and the surface flakes away sometimes up to a depth of 20mm due to differences in moisture movement between crust and body stone, or differences in thermal expansion"
are the pores of the crust layer blocked with calcium sulphate deposits?,–   the pores of the crust layer will be blocked with calcium sulphate deposits even though sandstone does not contain calcium carbonate
can lime mortars precipitate the pollution?,–   this is believed to occur as a result  of direct pollution with calcium sulphate  and can be precipitated by the use  of lime mortars
rusting can lead to fractures in what?,"rusting–   rusting and the subsequent expansion  of iron including cramps, ties and steelwork hidden in stonework can lead  to fractures in the stone"
the presence of iron in stonework is detected by rust stains emerging from cracks produced by,–   the presence of iron within stonework  is detected by rust stains emerging from cracks produced by the expansion
can you replace an iron rod?,–   in these cases the iron needs to be replaced by stainless steel or galvanised cramps or ties

how to prevent corrosion on metal railings?,please refer to section steel work corrosion see page 39.–   in the case of railings where the metal is partially embedded it should be caulked with a bituminous mastic or silicone  based compound
What type of bed should be laid so it is normal to load the load?,"stone our services brick, concrete, render terracotta, faience steel work corrosion contact  us13szerelmey restoration and conservation guide14 other f actors–   sedimentary rocks have a natural bed  and blocks of stone should be laid so  that the bed is normal to the load"
if this is not done then there can be a greater susceptibility to what type of decay?,"–   if this is not done then there can be areas of weakness, which can potentially lead  to greater susceptibility to different types of decay, unless measures are taken"
can dense pointing mortar cause increased crystallisation damage?,–   dense pointing mortar can also cause increased crystallisation damage by restricting the movement of water through it so that little evaporation  can take place at the joints
what must evaporate from the stone itself?,moisture  in the wall must then evaporate from  the stone itself and any salts will accumulate in the stone
What is the best material to use for a decayed stone?,"–   since it is normally cheaper to repoint than to replace decayed stone, it is advisable to use a slightly permeable mortar which will deteriorate in preference to the stone"
do you need stainless steel for stonework?,"–   the corrosion of steel or cast iron fixings can cause spalling of stonework. dowels and fixings should, therefore, be made  of nonferrous metal or stainless steel"
will removing the corrosion through cleaning is the most obvious and effective method?,"below: stone	cracking	due		to	steel	work	corrosionstone our services brick, concrete, render terracotta, faience steel work corrosion contact  usszerelmey restoration and conservation guide r emoval of soluble salts–   removing the cause through cleaning is the most obvious and effective method"
