is a stone more or less susceptible to frost damage?,"frost–   like salt crystallisation, frost damage to stone is directly influenced by the stone’s porosity – the more porous the stone, the more susceptible to frost damage it will be"
is there a reason for frost damage on the stone structure?,–   frost damage occurs due to the expansion of water during freezing; the expansion puts stress on the stone structure leading to cracking and damage
What is it called when a straw dislodges fragments of stone?,–   frost damage can also be the ‘final  straw’ that dislodges fragments of  stone that have been subjected to other types of decay
can soluble salts soak in to porous stone?,"cry stallisation of soluble salts–   salts occur naturally in the environment and can soak in to porous stone as  a result of rainwater, groundwater,  sea spray; sometimes salts can be  left as a byproduct of unsuitable  cleaning solutions"
when do salts crystallize within stone pores?,–   when salts crystallise within stone pores they can generate sufficient stress to cause fragmentation
"Due to the chemical reactions between limestone and acid pollutants in rainwater, what is the concentration","–   the concentration of salts and the damage they incur is increased due to the chemical reactions between limestone and acid pollutants in rainwater such as sulphuric acid, which produces gypsum (calcium sulphate)"
is gypsum the same as stone decay?,it is this gypsum that is most frequently associated with stone decay of limestone
what is it called when gypsum is formed over a stone?,"this moisture is invariably pollutantheavy and known as occult deposition. this encourages the formation of gypsum which forms a hard, filthy crust over the stone"
is there a such a thing as crystallization damage?,"–   crystallisation damage caused by freely soluble salts such as sodium chloride, sodium sulphate or sodium hydroxide normally consists of a powdering and crumbling of the entire surface of the contaminated stone"
is calcium carbonate and limestone the same thing?,"–   limestone and marble are primarily composed of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate) which dissolves readily in weak acid, making both these substances prone to decay from acid rain or air  born pollutants"
can some sandstones be resistant to acid rain?,"contour scaling–   while some sandstones are more resistant to acid rain than other types of stone, they can be prone to a type of decay called contour scaling"
Why does a crust form after the contours of the surface of the stone?,"–   a crust forms following the contours of the surface of the stone and the surface flakes away sometimes up to a depth of 20mm due to differences in moisture movement between crust and body stone, or differences in thermal expansion"
can lime mortars precipitate the pollution?,–   this is believed to occur as a result  of direct pollution with calcium sulphate  and can be precipitated by the use  of lime mortars

can dense pointing mortar cause increased crystallisation damage?,–   dense pointing mortar can also cause increased crystallisation damage by restricting the movement of water through it so that little evaporation  can take place at the joints
what must evaporate from the stone itself?,moisture  in the wall must then evaporate from  the stone itself and any salts will accumulate in the stone
What is the best material to use for a decayed stone?,"–   since it is normally cheaper to repoint than to replace decayed stone, it is advisable to use a slightly permeable mortar which will deteriorate in preference to the stone"
do you need stainless steel for stonework?,"–   the corrosion of steel or cast iron fixings can cause spalling of stonework. dowels and fixings should, therefore, be made  of nonferrous metal or stainless steel"
can you remove salts from the fabric of a stone?,–   a more effective method for removing salts from the fabric of the stone is the use of clay poulticing (see page 19 chemical cleaning and poultices)
"deep impregnation of stonework with specific, suitable resins is an example of","deep impregnation treatments–   these involve the deep impregnation  of stonework with specific, suitable resins"
do these treatments secure the decaying surface to the solid stone beneath?,–   these treatments secure the decaying surface to the solid stone beneath  and should prevent further crystallisation damage

can you use calcium carbonate powder for softer stones?,"–  one of the most common is aluminium oxide powder, or chalk or calcium carbonate powder for softer stones.–  a great draw back to air abrasion is the amount of dust it generates"
"If a stone is deemed to be unsafe, what should be done?","–  stone replacement should only be undertaken if the stone has decayed to such extent to be structurally unsound or unsafe, or if the deterioration is causing other issues"
can a new unit of defective stone be cut and replaced?,–  if the deterioration is extensive then  the entire unit of defective stone can  be cut and replaced with a new unit  of geologically compatible stone
the compatibility of the replacement stone is important to ensure it does not cause or contribute to what,"–  the compatibility of the replacement stone is most important to ensure that it does not cause or contribute to the decay of adjacent masonry, in addition there is an aesthetic consideration"
where should replacement stones be sourced?,–  ideally the replacement stone should be sourced from the same quarry as the original piece
can you remove the whole block of defective stone?,"stone indenting–  this repair process is used in cases where it is not possible to remove the entire block of defective stone i.e., if removal causes structural instability"
To ensure the adjacent masonry is not damaged or damaged when cutting out a damaged stone out,–  particular care is taken when cutting the damaged stone out to ensure the adjacent masonry is not also damaged
the rear of a new stone piece is secured to the existing stone using what?,–  the rear of the new stone piece is secured to the existing stone using nonferrous or stainless steel dowls that are chemically anchored
