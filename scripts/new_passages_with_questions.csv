"the phenomenon of sulphation occurs in areas of the marble sheltered from the rain water. in the presence of moisture and sulphur dioxide the calcium carbonate, main component of the marble, is transformed into calcium sulphate dehydrate (gypsum)",does calcium carbonate turn into calcium sulphate dehydrate?
at first fine gypsum crystals are formed and these subsequently change into large gypsum crystals. the fine crystals layer retains the relief of the surface,the fine crystals layer retains the relief of what?
"the fine crystals layer retains the relief of the surface.deposits of air pollutants are evident in areas protected from rainwater are airborne atmospheric pollutants and suspended particles such as soot, hydrocarbons, metallic oxides that have altered the colouration of the surfaces",what is evident in areas protected from rainwater?
"the black crusts are formed from successive deposits of gypsum, recrystallized calcium carbonate and various atmospheric pollutants.fractures, cracks and delamination many architectural members (blocks or elements) are fractured, and subsequently their morphology and geometry have been changed","What is formed from gypsum, calcium carbonate and various atmospheric pollutants?"
"the type of failure appears either in the form of fractures, cracks or in the form of delamination, which is the splintering – breaking off of large pieces from the surface of the marble",is it possible for a rock to break off a marble?
"most of the cracks have been caused by the rusting and swelling of the iron reinforcements, mainly from the balanos and orlandos restoration (1890 1937). there are also fractures that are the result of mechanical forces or heat (such as earthquakes, the fire in antiquity, and the explosion of 1687)",What caused most of the cracks in the iron reinforcements?
"there are also fractures that are the result of mechanical forces or heat (such as earthquakes, the fire in antiquity, and the explosion of 1687).disintegration and flaking are observable on areas of the surface where the marble has less coherence, so that more water penetrates and is retained",what is one cause of the fractures?
"this situation is due to many factors, such as the microstructure of the marble (silicate impurities), thermal fatigue of the surface from fire, and the circulation of soluble salts from previously used conservation materials such as the meyer cement",What is the term for thermal fatigue of the marble?
pitting erosion appears in the form of semi spherical holes either sporadically or in clusters. it is caused by the activity of micro organisms whose development is favoured by increased humidity. it appears chiefly on the north side of the monuments and it is worse in areas with silicate veining,where does pitting erosion appear?
"it appears chiefly on the north side of the monuments and it is worse in areas with silicate veining.in addition to the damage created by the rusting of the iron reinforcements, there are problems resulting from the mortars used in the past treatments to join fragments and to point cracks",where is silicate veining on the monuments?
"most are based on sorrel or meyer cement, which was used extensively on the monuments, including also the statues of the acropolis, for more than 80 years. it is a white plaster with two basic components, magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride",How long was meyer cement used on monuments for?
"today, most of the mortars of this type are flaking or powdering, producing soluble salts and the adjoining marble crumbles since 1975 when esma took over the coordination and supervision of the works the use of meyer cement on the acropolis monuments was suspended",when did esma take over the coordination and supervision of the works?
"biodeterioration factors research by microbiologists has revealed the presence of a variety of microbial colonies, consisted of bacteria, algae, fungi and lichens. the biological factor in the physico chemical damage to the marble has been shown to be significant",What has been shown to be significant in the physico chemical damage to the marble?
"both epilithic and hasmolithic microflora alter the colour of the monuments’ surface, the secretion of erosive compounds from various micro organisms causes the dissolution of the calcium carbonate and a large part of the microflora exerts micro pressures resulting in surface decay",Which microflora can change the color of monuments’ surface?
"mortar is one of the oldest building materials. it consists of a mixture of one or more binders (lime, cement), water, and natural aggregates (quarry pit sand, shells, etc.) which after the binder has hardened and set acquires tremendous strength",What is one of the oldest building materials?
) which after the binder has hardened and set acquires tremendous strength. depending on the type of setting and hardening which in turn depends on the type of cement used mortars may be divided into hydraulic and non hydraulic,is hydraulic and hydraulic the same thing?
"hydraulic mortars are those with the property of setting and hardening when they come into contact with water.thanks to its hydraulic and insulation properties, it guaranteed that spaces would be waterproof",hydraulic mortars guaranteed that spaces would be what?
"thanks to its hydraulic and insulation properties, it guaranteed that spaces would be waterproof.lime mortar today is primarily used in the conservation of buildings originally built using lime mortar, but may be used as an alternative to ordinary portland cement",is lime mortar the same as portland cement?
"it is made principally of lime (hydraulic, or non hydraulic), water and an aggregate such as sand. portland cement has proven to be incompatible with lime mortar because it is harder, less flexible, and impermeable",is portland cement the same as lime mortar?
"these qualities lead to premature deterioration of soft, historic bricks so traditionally, low temperature fired, lime mortars are recommended for use with existing mortar of a similar type or reconstruction of buildings using historically correct methods",can lime mortars be used to rebuild buildings?
"in the past, lime mortar tended to be mixed on site with whatever sand was locally available. since the sand influences the colour of the lime mortar, colours of pointing mortar can vary dramatically from district to district.",can the colour of the lime mortar vary from district to district?
