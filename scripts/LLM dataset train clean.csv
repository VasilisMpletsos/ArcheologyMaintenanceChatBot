Is there any compatibility between stone and consolidant?,,Yes there is and you must ensure that your consolidant is compatible with the stone.
What  thermal properties consolidants should have?,"specific compatibility requirements should include the following:cured consolidants should have thermal dimensional properties similar to those of sound stone [16, 73]",Consolidants should the same thermal properties as the stone.
How delamination of the consolidated stone occurs?,"otherwise, delamination of the consolidated stone from the untreated stone could occur [76], especially if the stone is subjected to thermal shock. in addition, the cured consolidant should not become brittle [16, 76, 77]",If the consolidant has not the same thermal properties then delamination occurs.
Should the consolidant disrupt the microstructure of the stone?,"in addition, the cured consolidant should not become brittle [16, 76, 77].the consolidant should not severely disrupt the microstructure of the stone [16]",No the consolidant should not severely disrupt the microstructure of the stone.
How a consolidant can lead to microcracks?,"for example, if the crystals formed from the precipitation of an inorganic consolidant exhibit crystal growth sufficient tensile stresses may be produced to cause the development of microcracks, and ultimately macrocracks in the matrix",If the crystals formed from the precipitation of an inorganic consolidant exhibit crystal growth sufficient tensile stresses may be produced to cause the development of microcracks.
Is hydrofluoric acid good for the stone?,"g., hydrofluoric acid, depend on their reacting with the constituents of the stone to form insoluble products. many conservators [5, 16, 76, 78] are opposed to the use of such materials because the reaction products usually fill the voids and pores, thereby sealing the surfaces","No many conservators are opposed to the use of such materials because the reaction products usually fill the voids and pores, thereby sealing the surfaces."
What consolidants are harmful for stone?,"consolidants should not form by products which can be harmful to the stone. many of the inorganic consolidants are precipitated as a result of the reaction between two dissolved salts [1, 16, 50]",Many of the inorganic consolidants are harmful to the stone.
How can soluble salts damage a stone?,"in addition to the precipitate, at least one soluble salt is formed, much of which is deposited in the stone as the water evaporates. these soluble salts can damage the stone through recrystallization processes and/or produce unsightly efflorescence on the treated stone's surface",The soluble salts can damage the stone through recrystallization processes and/or produce unsightly efflorescence on the treated stone's surface.
Can soluble salts damage a stone?,,Yes they can.
Are soluble salts bad for the stone?,,Yes soluble salts are harmful to the stone.
Are norganic consolidants produce white deposits on stone?,"effect on appearance ideally the application of a stone consolidant would not cause any change in the appearance of a stone. most inorganic consolidants, however, produce a white deposit within the voids and pores of a stone, the color of which may not match the color of the stone","Yes, most inorganic consolidants produce a white deposit within the voids and pores of a stone, the color of which may not match the color of the stone."
Organic consolidants can change the reflective properties of what?,"while organic consolidants usually form transparent polymers when cured, they can change the reflective properties of a stone [79]",The organic consolidants usually form transparent polymers when cured they can change the reflective properties of a stone.
How optical properties of organic polymers gradually change?,"further, the optical properties of organic polymers may gradually change because of their degradation by photochemical processes, oxidation by oxygen and ozone, and attack by air pollutants","The optical properties of organic polymers may gradually change because of their degradation by photochemical processes, oxidation by oxygen and ozone and attack by air pollutants."
How do most inorganic consolidants produce a white insoluble phase?,"most inorganic consolidants produce a white insoluble phase within the voids and pores of a stone, either by precipitation of a salt or by chemical reactions with the stone","Most inorganic consolidants produce a white insoluble phase within the voids and pores of a stone, either by precipitation of a salt or by chemical reactions with the stone."
What consolidants should be used for sandstone?,"for example, consolidants which result in the formation of a silica phase should be used to consolidate sandstone, and calcium carbonate or barium carbonate used to consolidate calcareous stones such as limestone",Consolidants which result in the formation of a silica phase should be used to consolidate sandstone.
What consolidants should be used for limestone?,"for example, consolidants which result in the formation of a silica phase should be used to consolidate sandstone, and calcium carbonate or barium carbonate used to consolidate calcareous stones such as limestone",Calcium carbonate or barium carbonate should be used to consolidate limestone.
How much success has been achieved in consolidating stone with inorganic materials?,"in practice, however, little concern is given to chemical compatibility between the consolidants and stone.little success has been achieved in consolidating stone with inorganic materials, and in some cases their use has greatly accelerated stone decay [16, 50, 78]",Little success has been achieved in consolidating stone with inorganic materials and in some cases their use has greatly accelerated stone decay.
Are inorganic consolidants good for stone?,,No they are not.
Are inorganic consolidants harmful for stone?,,Yes probably they are.
Why inorganic consolidants peform poorly?,"some of the reasons given for the poor performance of inorganic consolidants are their tendencies to produce shallow and hard crusts [16, 60, 76], the formation of soluble salts as reaction by products [1, 16, 60, 86, 87], growth of precipitated crystals [50], and the questionable ability of some of them to bind stone particles together [6, 85]",They tend to produce shallow and hard crusts.
What is the most important problem of inorganic stone consolidants?,"of these, the most difficult problem to overcome is the formation of shallow hard surface layers by inorganic consolidants because of their poor penetration abilities",The formation of shallow hard surface layers by inorganic consolidants because of their poor penetration abilities.
