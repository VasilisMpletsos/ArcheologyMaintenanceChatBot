  - text: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase? Tell me the material and the degradation you have and I will try to help you. The materials i know about are for marble, stone, shale, mortar and shell_stone and the degradations cracks, sulphation, cavities, crystal decomposition, disintegration and infection.
