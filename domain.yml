  - text: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase? Tell me the material and the degradation you have and I will try to help you. The materials i know about are for marble, stone, shale, mortar and shell_stone and the degradations cracks, sulfation, cavities, crystal decomposition, disintegration and infection.

  utter_default:
  - text: "I'm sorry, I only know for restoration. You can say for example:\n
  - How to maintain marble with cracks\n
  - What causes disintegration?\n
  - What are your abilities?
  - We have found a stone structure with degradations"
