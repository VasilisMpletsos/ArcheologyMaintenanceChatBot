      - text: It is recommended to inject additional mortar if the stability of the structure is threatened.
      - text: It is recommended to remove the old mortar that seems not to withstand the weather conditions and to add a new stronger one such as Theraic lime mortar.
      - text: You can carefully remove the old mortar and install a new one of higher strength such as theraica lime mortar.

      utter_mortar_with_sulfuration:
      - text: The sulfuration in the mortar can be removed using suitable chemical solvents such as ethanol or ether. You can use a soft brush to clean the mortar gently.
      - text: Removal of sulfuration from corroded ligaments is achieved with neutralized thioglycolic acid solution.
      - text: It is recommended to use a neutralized thioglycolic acid solution to treat sulfuration.

      utter_mortar_with_cracks:
      - text: It is recommended to fill it with a matching mortar if it is durable or if the use of the new mortar has failed
      - text: For cracks in the mortar, it is recommended to use cement mortar or lime mortar that can withstand large changes
      - text: It is recommended to fill with mortar with the same thermal coefficient. However, if it is estimated that the old one has failed, it is recommended to remove it completely and inject a new one.

      utter_mortar_with_disintegration:
      - text: The thermal changes lead to flaking of the material due to the different thermal expansion with the joined materials. For this reason, filling with mortar of the same thermal coefficient as the materials to be joined is recommended.
      - text: It is recommended to carefully remove the old mortar that does not seem to withstand the weather conditions and to add a new stronger one such as the Theraic lime mortar.

      utter_mortar_with_cavities:
      - text: If there are cavities in the mortar, it is recommended to fill them with a corresponding mortar composition of the time, while if you wish to install something stronger, it should be made of inert materials.
      - text: It is recommended to fill it with a corresponding mortar if it is durable or if the use of new mortar has failed
