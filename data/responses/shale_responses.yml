      - text: To deal with the sugaring of the shale, the only thing we can do is surface fixation with sprays (ammonium oxalate) or impregnations, but the damage up to this point is irreparable. In general, the rate of corrosion in shale objects with saccharification is faster than that ie shales.

      - text: Preserving the integrity of the shale requires addressing the underlying causes of cavity formation, such as water penetration or pollutants, to prevent further damage. In instances of existing cavities, filling them with materials suitable for historical structures of that era is highly recommended.

      utter_shale_with_infection:
      - text: "Since we have shale with microbial contamination, the conditions that favor their growth must first be checked and then appropriate biocides can be used after first researching the possible side effects on the surface of the shale.
      \nFor safer solutions there are other more traditional methods.
      \nA frequent intervention for lichens is the mechanical method of scraping, although the process does not prevent their growth and must be repeated constantly.
      \nFor mosses, the best known and most effective method is removal by hand. auxiliary tools that can be used with care are a hard brush, a metal brush, but also a spatula or a metal shovel.
      \nFor the removal of the black crust, the use of anaerobic thiobacteria such as Desulfovibrio has been shown.
      \nIn general, for preventive maintenance, the removal of moisture and generally its control if this is possible. In archaeological sites where rainfall is high, the placement of a roof is very important."
