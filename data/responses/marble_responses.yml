      utter_marble_with_infection:
      - text: "Since we have marble with microbial contamination, the conditions that favor their growth must first be checked and appropriate biocides can then be used after first investigating the possible side effects on the marble surface.\n
      For safer solutions there are other more traditional methods. A frequent intervention for lichens is the mechanical method of scraping, although the process does not prevent their growth and must be repeated continuously.\n
      For mosses, the best-known and most effective method is removal by hand. The auxiliary tools that can be used with care are a hard brush, a metal brush, but also a spatula or a metal shovel. For the removal of the black crust, the use of anaerobic thiobacteria has been highlighted.\n
      In general, for preventive maintenance, it is advisable to remove moisture and generally control it if this is possible. In archaeological sites where rainfall is high, the placement of a roof is very important."
