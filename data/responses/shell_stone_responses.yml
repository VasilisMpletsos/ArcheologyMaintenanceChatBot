      - text: The use of special resins that secure the surface of the stone from crystallization damage is recommended.

      utter_shell_stone_with_sulphation:
      - text: To protect the shell stone from sulphation it is recommended to use n-semiconductor material but also to first use potassium carbonate to reverse the sulphation.
      - text: In order to protect the shell stone from sulphation you must use n-semiconductor material and potassium carbonate to reverse the sulphation.
      - text: It could help to use apply a material made of n-semiconductor that helps protect against sulphation and UV radiation.
